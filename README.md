STEPS ON HOW THE PROJECT WILL BE
1. Created the backend, s3 bucket, sns notification, lambda and eventbridge through terraform

2. Install Dependencies Locally
Run the following command to install the dependencies into a python directory:
pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/
This creates a folder python/ containing all the required dependencies.
Note: if you have issues installing pip on your terminal, then do the following:
-- Run:curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
-- Execute the script: python get-pip.py
-- Verify if PIP is installed: pip --version

3. Add Your lambda.py
Move lambda.py into the python/ directory:
